# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nikita

Most of my commercial work has been hosted on private GitHub repositories owned by companies I've worked with, which are no longer accessible after project completion.  

Here you can find:  
- Several repositories from 2018â€“2020 (prepared for my early jobs and freelance work)  
- My latest personal project: [**Next Pizza**](https://github.com/solteax/next-pizza) â€” see the README for more details

âš¡ While this profile may not be highly active, it reflects part of my development journey. My recent work includes developing modular front-end component libraries, implementing real-time data features, and delivering fully tested React/TypeScript applications optimized for B2B platforms.
